# Project Information

SafeWorkPay is a freelancing platform for **IT projects and coding tasks**. It uses **Blockchain** and **AI** technology to make sure clients and freelancers have a **secure and fair experience**.

Here's how it works:

- **Blockchain** handles all payments, so transactions are transparent and secure.
- In Case of **Dispute** **AI** checks the code submitted by freelancers and check the **completion percentage** of the project.
- This approach helps avoid the common problems with other platforms, like **high fees, payment delays, biased and manual dispute resolution**.

## üìú Deployment Notes

#### Sonic Testnet

The smart contracts are already deployed on the **Sonic Testnet** at the following addresses:

| Contract Name | Address                                                                                                                            |

| **USDT**      | [`0x7BBfC9Ea272595D794990A8C2ea615d95ECe3673`](https://testnet.sonicscan.org/address/0x7BBfC9Ea272595D794990A8C2ea615d95ECe3673) |

üîó _You can visit the [Sonic Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.sonicscan.org/) to check the transactions._

## Problem Statement

- Freelancing platforms often face **payment disputes and trust issues**.
- Clients may **withhold funds** even when work is completed.
- Developers may **fail to deliver** after receiving payment.
- These issues **discourage honest participation** and reduce efficiency.
- There‚Äôs a **need for a secure, transparent, and fair system** to build trust between **clients** and **freelancers**.

---

## Solution Overview

- **SafeWorkPay** is a **decentralized freelancing platform** powered by **blockchain and AI**.
- Clients deposit funds into a **smart contract**, which **holds the money in escrow**.
- **Funds are released** only when full projects are **completed and verified**.
- In case of **Dispute** **AI** checks the code submitted by freelancers and check the **completion percentage** of the project.
- The AI helps in **resolving disputes** fairly by releasing funds **proportionally** (e.g., 50% work = 50% payment).
- SafeWorkPay is better than other platforms because it combines two powerful technologies:

  - **Blockchain's trust:** This makes payments secure and transparent.
  - **AI's analysis:** This checks the quality of the code automatically.

This makes it more reliable than traditional platforms like **Upwork** or simpler blockchain-based platforms like **Ethlance**, which don't have this combination of features.

---

## How SafeWorkPay Works

1.  **Project Posting:** A client posts a project with a title, description, keywords, and a budget range.
2.  **Bidding:** Freelancers submit bids that fit within the client's budget.
3.  **Hiring:** The client accepts a bid, and the agreed-upon payment is locked in a secure smart contract.
4.  **Work Submission:** The freelancer finishes the project and provides a link to the completed code on GitHub.
5.  **Review and Payment:**
    - **If the client approves the work,** the full payment is instantly released to the freelancer.
    - **If the client doesn't approve,** either party can start a dispute.
6.  **Dispute Resolution:** An AI system analyzes the project's details and the submitted code to determine the percentage of completion. Based on this analysis, the funds are split fairly between the client and the freelancer.

---

## Key Advantages

- **Low Fees:** Transaction fees are very low, regardless of the project's size.
- **Fast Payments:** Payments are instant and work across different countries without the delays or currency issues of traditional banks.
- **Quick Disputes:** An AI-powered system resolves disputes 24/7, offering a fast, accurate, and unbiased solution.
- **No Middlemen:** Smart contracts handle payments directly, making the process transparent and immediate.
- **Specialized and Accurate:** Because the platform focuses only on IT projects, the AI can analyze code to resolve disputes with high accuracy.
